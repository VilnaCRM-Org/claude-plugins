# Test Plan — install-lifecycle (Round 1)

Surface: real `claude` CLI (2.1.173) plugin lifecycle for
`php-backend-sdlc@vilnacrm-plugins` against the local directory
marketplace at `/home/kravtsov/Projects/claude-plugins`: details
inventory, uninstall, reinstall, update, and integrity of the installed
cache copy at
`~/.claude/plugins/cache/vilnacrm-plugins/php-backend-sdlc/<version>/`.

Contracts: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and the marketplace manifest,
plugin `README.md` (Install section, 21-skill library + 8 commands +
6 subagents), `scripts/lib/common.sh` plugin-root resolution contract,
`commands/sdlc-setup.md` `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` invocations, PRD
`specs/autonomous/2026-06-09-php-backend-sdlc-plugin/prd.md`,
`docs/testing/test-strategy.md` severity ladder.

## Method

- No git mutations in `/home/kravtsov/Projects/claude-plugins`; the
  branch stays `feature/php-backend-sdlc-plugin` throughout.
- Sandboxes for script execution: `/tmp/sdlc-test-install-lifecycle/`,
  deleted after the run.
- Source-vs-cache comparison uses tracked files only (`git ls-files`)
  for the completeness contract; untracked working-tree files are
  recorded informationally (IL-E2).
- "CACHE" below means the versioned install dir reported by
  `installed_plugins.json` (`.../php-backend-sdlc/0.1.0`).
- Every FAIL is reproduced twice before being recorded; installed +
  enabled state is restored at the end (IL-R1).
- Note on inventory counting: CLI ≥ 2.1 unifies commands into the
  "Skills" section of `plugin details`, so the expected skills line is
  21 library skills + 8 `sdlc*` commands = 29 entries, plus 6 agents.

## Positive cases

| ID | Scenario | Expected | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IL-P1 | `claude plugin details php-backend-sdlc` while installed | exit 0; version 0.1.0; source `php-backend-sdlc@vilnacrm-plugins`; skills list = 21 skill dirs + 8 command names, agents list = the 6 `agents/*.md`; 0 hooks/MCP/LSP | PASS |
| IL-P2 | `claude plugin list` state | plugin present, version 0.1.0, scope user, enabled | PASS |
| IL-P3 | `claude plugin uninstall php-backend-sdlc@vilnacrm-plugins` | exit 0; gone from `plugin list`; registry entry removed; cache copy removed or inert | PASS |
| IL-P4 | `claude plugin install php-backend-sdlc@vilnacrm-plugins` after uninstall | exit 0; reappears enabled at 0.1.0; cache repopulated; registry `gitCommitSha` = current HEAD | PASS |
| IL-P5 | `claude plugin update php-backend-sdlc` on fresh install | exit 0; reports up-to-date or re-syncs; cache still consistent afterwards | PASS |
| IL-P6 | Cache completeness vs tracked source: every `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, `tests/`, `README.md`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` file | every tracked file present in CACHE and byte-identical to the working tree | PASS |
| IL-P7 | Executable bits on `scripts/*.sh` + `scripts/lib/common.sh` + `tests/fixtures/bin/*` in CACHE | mode 755 (or at least u+x) preserved exactly as in source | PASS |
| IL-P8 | Relative markdown links between cache files (`skills/*/SKILL.md` cross-references, `README.md` → `docs/*`, command/agent doc links) | every relative link target resolves to an existing file INSIDE the cache | PASS |
| IL-P9 | Run `"$CACHE/scripts/setup-preflight.sh" --report` from a sandbox git repo with `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="$CACHE"` | script runs from cache, sources `lib/common.sh` from cache, prints full PASS/FAIL table; exit reflects environment, not a path error | PASS |
| IL-P10 | `claude plugin validate` on the plugin dir and on the marketplace root | both exit 0, manifest valid | PASS |

## Negative cases

| ID | Scenario | Expected | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IL-N1 | `claude plugin details no-such-plugin-xyz` | non-zero exit; clean "not found" error, no stack trace | PASS |
| IL-N2 | Second `claude plugin uninstall` while not installed | non-zero exit; clean error naming the plugin | PASS |
| IL-N3 | `claude plugin install no-such-plugin-xyz@vilnacrm-plugins` | non-zero exit; clean error; no cache dir created | PASS |
| IL-N4 | Missing-dir `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` contract: (a) source cache `lib/common.sh`, call `resolve_plugin_root` with `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT=/nonexistent-qa-dir`; (b) same env against `setup-preflight.sh --report` | (a) die `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT points to a missing directory: …`, exit 1; (b) preflight unaffected (it never consumes the plugin root — scripts self-locate via `BASH_SOURCE`) | PASS (a: die exit 1; b: exit 0, bogus env harmless; see notes) |

## Edge cases

| ID | Scenario | Expected | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IL-E1 | Stale-cache refresh: cache snapshot predating HEAD (observed pre-test: missing `docs/evidence/*`, older scripts) then `claude plugin update` | update re-syncs the cache to the marketplace working tree; previously-missing tracked files appear; changed scripts match HEAD | DEVIATION — update is version-gated: exits 0 with `already at the latest version (0.1.0)` and leaves stale cache content untouched (reproduced twice). Judged NOT a defect: consistent with `docs/release-process.md` ("every release bumps `version`") and standard package semantics; re-sync path is uninstall + reinstall (verified). See notes |
| IL-E2 | Untracked working-tree files (`docs/testing/`) at install time | informational: record whether directory-source install copies untracked files; contract covers tracked files only | PASS (informational — untracked files ARE copied; see notes) |
| IL-E3 | `claude plugin install` while already installed | clean "already installed"-style outcome or idempotent reinstall; no corruption, still enabled | PASS |
| IL-E4 | `claude plugin disable` then `claude plugin enable` round trip | status toggles in `plugin list`; cache untouched | PASS |
| IL-E5 | Grep CACHE scripts/docs for baked-in absolute source paths (`/home/kravtsov/Projects`) | no absolute source-tree path required at runtime by any cached script | PASS (hits are doc/test-plan prose only, none load-bearing) |
| IL-E6 | Run `"$CACHE/scripts/setup-preflight.sh"` from cache WITHOUT `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` set | `common.sh` self-locates via `BASH_SOURCE`; identical behavior to IL-P9 | PASS |

## Restore

| ID | Scenario | Expected | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IL-R1 | End state after all cases | plugin installed at 0.1.0, enabled, cache complete (IL-P6 re-checked post-restore); sandboxes under `/tmp/sdlc-test-install-lifecycle` deleted | PASS |

## Notes and observations

- IL-P1: `plugin details` shows "Skills (29)" because CLI 2.1.x folds
  the 8 commands into the unified skills inventory; all 21 + 8 + 6
  names match the source tree one-for-one (set-diff empty). Not a
  defect.
- IL-P3: uninstall removes the registry entry and the plugin from
  `plugin list`; the versioned cache dir is retained on disk but inert
  (no registry pointer). Reinstall re-snapshots it from the
  marketplace directory.
- IL-P4: after reinstall the registry `gitCommitSha` equals the repo
  HEAD (`c157eea…`) and the cache is byte-identical to the working
  tree (file list, contents, and permission modes all match).
- IL-P5/IL-E1: `update` compares only `version` in `plugin.json`.
  With an unchanged 0.1.0 it exits 0 reporting already-latest and
  performs no content sync — same-version drift (e.g. the genuinely
  stale pre-test snapshot at `21268f6`, seven commits behind HEAD
  including the fr-nfr-gate symlink fix) is not propagated by
  `update`. Consistent with `docs/release-process.md` (every release
  bumps the version), so classified informational, not a defect.
  Dev-loop refresh is uninstall + reinstall.
- CLI naming quirk (informational): `claude plugin update
  php-backend-sdlc` (bare name) fails with `Plugin "php-backend-sdlc"
  not found` while `details`/`uninstall` accept the bare name; the
  `plugin@marketplace` form works everywhere. claude CLI behavior,
  not a plugin artifact.
- IL-N4/IL-E6: no shipped script invokes `resolve_plugin_root`;
  every script self-locates via `BASH_SOURCE`, so all seven scripts
  run correctly from the cache with `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` set,
  unset, or bogus. The library die-path contract itself holds
  (`[php-sdlc][ERROR] CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT points to a missing
  directory: …`, exit 1).
- IL-P9: full preflight from the cache passes all 8 checks (git repo,
  claude 2.1.173, gh 2.92.0 authed, bmalph 2.11.0, doctor deferred on
  fresh repo, python3+PyYAML, jq), exit 0. A second cache script
  (`validate-profile.sh` against the cache's `valid.yml` fixture)
  also runs clean from the cache, exit 0.
- IL-E2: directory-source installs snapshot the whole plugin dir
  including untracked files (`docs/testing/` was untracked yet
  copied); the tracked-files completeness contract is met a fortiori.

## Verdict summary

- Cases run: 21 (10 positive + 4 negative + 6 edge + restore;
  deviation-confirmation re-runs not counted).
- Confirmed defects: 0. Two informational deviations recorded
  (version-gated `update` no-resync at IL-E1; bare-name `update`
  lookup quirk) — both claude CLI semantics consistent with or
  outside the plugin's shipped contract, per the strategy's
  "not bugs" carve-outs.
- Environment notes: host has bmalph 2.11.0, gh 2.92.0 (authed),
  jq, python3+PyYAML; `yq` absent (python fallback path is the one
  exercised).

## Round 2 (verification + regression hunt)

Independent re-run against the committed tree at HEAD `ad6497e` (the
round-1 fix commit). Purpose: (1) confirm the cache actually refreshes
to the NEW source tree on reinstall — the pre-test cache was the stale
`c157eea` snapshot, seven-plus commits behind HEAD and lacking every
round-1 fix; (2) re-run all round-1 cases from the refreshed cache; (3)
hunt regressions in the five round-1 fix areas (validate-profile
digit-string ceiling/floor, generate-profile `:=` make-target parsing,
setup-preflight work-tree check, inject-governance atomic write, the
qa/finish-pr counter-transport doc contract). Scripts executed FROM THE
CACHE with `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` set to the cache, cwd
`/home/kravtsov/Projects/tmp/php-sdlc-qa/php-service-template`.
Sandboxes under `/tmp/sdlc-test2-install-lifecycle/`, removed after the
run. No git mutations. Host: claude 2.1.173, gh 2.92.0 (authed), bmalph
2.11.0, jq, python3+PyYAML (`yq` absent), bats 1.11.1,
markdownlint-cli2 0.22.1.

### Lifecycle re-runs (real `claude` CLI)

| ID | Scenario | Expected | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R2-IL-P1 | `plugin details` inventory | Skills(29)=21 lib+8 `sdlc*`, Agents(6), Hooks/MCP/LSP 0 | PASS |
| R2-IL-P2 | `plugin list` state | present, 0.1.0, user, enabled | PASS |
| R2-IL-P3 | `plugin uninstall …@vilnacrm-plugins` | exit 0; gone from list; registry entry removed; stale cache dir retained but inert | PASS |
| R2-IL-P4 | reinstall after uninstall (stale cache present) | exit 0; re-enabled at 0.1.0; registry `gitCommitSha` = HEAD `ad6497e` (was `c157eea`) | PASS |
| R2-IL-P5 | `plugin update` on fresh install | exit 0; `already at the latest version (0.1.0)` | PASS |
| R2-IL-P6 | cache vs tracked source byte-identity | 106 tracked files: 0 missing, 0 differ vs HEAD-committed; the only working-tree drift (plan `.md` files) is uncommitted edits from parallel round-2 agents — cache == HEAD-committed for every one | PASS |
| R2-IL-P7 | exec bits in refreshed cache | 7 `scripts/*.sh` = 775 (u+x); `lib/common.sh` = 664 (sourced, self-guards exec); `tests/fixtures/bin/{bmalph,claude,gh}` = 775; all match source | PASS |
| R2-IL-P8 | relative md links inside cache | 232 links checked, 0 broken | PASS |
| R2-IL-P9 | `setup-preflight.sh --report` from cache, env=cache, cwd=QA template | sources `lib/common.sh` from cache; all 8 checks PASS; exit 0 | PASS |
| R2-IL-P9b | `generate-profile.sh` then `validate-profile.sh` from cache against QA template | profile created (engine `postgresql` from active `pdo_pgsql`, commented `mysql://` DSN excluded; make targets resolved); validate exit 0 | PASS |
| R2-IL-P10 | `plugin validate` on plugin dir + marketplace root | both exit 0, `Validation passed` | PASS |
| R2-IL-N1 | `plugin details no-such-plugin-xyz` | exit 1; clean not-found, no stack trace | PASS |

| R2-IL-E3 | install while already installed | exit 0; idempotent `already installed`; still enabled | PASS |
| R2-IL-E4 | disable then enable round trip | status toggles; cache byte-unchanged after | PASS |
| R2-IL-E5 | grep cache scripts for `/home/kravtsov/Projects` | none in `scripts/` | PASS |
| R2-IL-E6 | preflight from cache WITHOUT `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` | self-locates via `BASH_SOURCE`; all checks PASS, exit 0 | PASS |

### Cache-refresh verification (the headline case)

| ID | Scenario | Expected | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R2-IL-CR1 | pre-reinstall cache content signature | stale `c157eea`: `num_gt`=0, `write_managed`=0, work-tree fix absent — lacks every round-1 fix | CONFIRMED stale |
| R2-IL-CR2 | post-reinstall cache content | refreshed to HEAD: `num_gt`=4 in `validate-profile.sh`, `write_managed`=3 in `inject-governance.sh`, work-tree `== "true"` guard + `[^=:]` make guard present; full `diff -rq` of scripts/commands/agents vs source = empty | PASS — reinstall re-snapshots the cache to the NEW tree |

### Round-1 regression re-verification (from cache)

| ID | Scenario | Expected | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R2-IL-WT1 | preflight in a bare repo | git-repo FAIL (round-1 fix; was a false PASS) | PASS |
| R2-IL-WT2 | preflight inside a `.git/` dir | git-repo FAIL | PASS |
| R2-IL-WT3 | preflight in a non-repo dir | git-repo FAIL with remediation | PASS |
| R2-IL-WT4 | preflight in a normal work tree | git-repo PASS | PASS |
| R2-IL-VP1 | `deptrac_violations: 18446744073709551615` (2^64-1 ceiling) | VIOLATION, never wrapped to negative (ADR-7) | PASS |
| R2-IL-VP2 | leading-zero ceiling `00` / `"007"` | `00`→0 valid; `007`→magnitude 7 > 0 VIOLATION | PASS |
| R2-IL-VP3 | floor at/below default (94 / 93) and huge raise (`99999999999999999999`) | 94 valid, 93 VIOLATION, huge raise valid | PASS |
| R2-IL-VP4 | malformed YAML profile | clean `[php-sdlc]` diagnostic, no backend traceback | PASS |
| R2-IL-MK1 | Makefile with `tests := v`, `psalm:=v` (assignments) vs real `ci`/`start`/`deptrac` targets, plus a name appearing as both `::=` and a real target | assignments → null; real targets (incl. the dual `ci`) detected; bare `tests:`, `ci::`, comment-only prereq all resolve correctly | PASS |
| R2-IL-GV1 | inject-governance from cache: fresh create, idempotency, CRLF tolerance | one block; second run unchanged; CRLF file not duplicated, user content kept | PASS |
| R2-IL-GV2 | inject-governance symlink rejection | `CLAUDE.md -> outside` refused; outside file intact; link not followed | PASS |
| R2-IL-GV3 | inject-governance write_managed on read-only TARGET | clean die `cannot create temp file`; existing `CLAUDE.md` NOT truncated; no leftover `.sdlc-governance.*` temp | PASS |
| R2-IL-GV4 | inject-governance `--diff` preview | no write to `CLAUDE.md` | PASS |
| R2-IL-CT1 | counter-transport docs in cache (`sdlc-qa.md`, `qa-manual-tester.md`, `sdlc-finish-pr.md`) | command commits to passing the iteration number; agent expects + resumes from it; `/sdlc-qa` defines the `MAX_ITERATIONS=5` guard; finish-pr owns counter B — internally consistent, no doc-reality gap | PASS |
| R2-IL-BATS | full bats suite from cache (164 tests) | every round-1 fix test passes (bare repo, `.git/` dir, uint64-wrap ceiling, huge raise, malformed YAML); 162 pass; the 2 non-passes (#56 plugin.json-name == dir, #58 marketplace.json) are test-harness layout assumptions that only hold in the SOURCE tree — both PASS when the suite runs from source (exit 0, 164/164) | PASS (no plugin defect) |

### Notes (Round 2)

- Headline result (R2-IL-CR1/CR2): reinstall DOES refresh the cache to
  the current source tree. The pre-test cache was genuinely stale
  (`c157eea`, lacking all round-1 fixes); after `uninstall` +
  `install` the cache is byte-identical to HEAD `ad6497e` and the
  registry `gitCommitSha` advanced to HEAD. The version-gated `update`
  no-resync from round-1 IL-E1 still stands (update on an unchanged
  0.1.0 reports already-latest and syncs nothing) — uninstall +
  reinstall is the dev-loop refresh path, and it works.
- R2-IL-BATS: running the cached bats suite surfaced two failures
  (#56, #58) that are NOT plugin defects. They assert repo-layout
  invariants — `basename(PLUGIN_ROOT) == plugin.json .name` and the
  existence of `REPO_ROOT/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — that by
  design only hold in the source tree. In the per-version install
  cache `PLUGIN_ROOT` is `…/php-backend-sdlc/0.1.0` (basename `0.1.0`)
  and the repo-level `marketplace.json` is not snapshotted (the cache
  holds only the plugin subtree). Both tests PASS from source. The
  cache content is correct; the tests are source-tree-relative.
- "lockfile in inject-governance" from the regression brief: the
  shipped fix uses an atomic in-dir `mktemp` + `mv` (no lockfile).
  Verified the claimed last-writer-wins/no-torn-read behavior plus the
  hardening it carries (symlink rejection, mode preservation,
  truncation safety on a read-only dir, temp-file cleanup on failure)
  — all hold.
- Every round-1 FAIL re-run in Round 2 now passes; no regressions found
  in any of the five fix areas. Confirmed NEW defects: 0.

### Verdict summary (Round 2)

- Cases run: 36 (19 lifecycle re-runs + 2 cache-refresh + 15
  regression re-verifications; sub-case repetitions and
  reproduced-twice confirmations not counted separately).
- r1FailsNowPass: true — every round-1 FAIL that was fixed and re-run
  (work-tree preflight, uint64-wrap ceiling, `:=` make parsing,
  inject-governance atomic write / CRLF, malformed-YAML diagnostic,
  counter transport) now passes from the refreshed cache.
- Confirmed defects: 0.
